> [!cite] Source 8: UO's Resource System (The Ecology)
> **Citation:** Koster, R. (2006). *Raph Koster's Website*. [Link](https://www.raphkoster.com/2006/06/03/uos-resource-system/)
> **Category:** `#systems` `#mechanics`
> * **What it covers:** The lead designer of *Ultima Online* details the exact code logic used for the ecology such as`PRODUCE FUR`, `EAT GRASS`, `DESIRE GOLD`. He explains the math behind the "resource system" that was meant to drive the economy and why they had to disable it.
> * **Why it is valuable:** It serves as the ultimate case study in "Systemic Fragility." It demonstrates that when you design a living world, you cannot just code the biology; you must also code for the chaotic human element (the players) who will inevitably break it.
> * **Who would benefit:** Systems designers and AI engineers trying to create self-sustaining virtual worlds.
> * **Limitations:** It is a retrospective on a 1997 game, so the specific code examples are outdated, even if the design philosophy is timeless.
