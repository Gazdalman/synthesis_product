> [!cite] Source 2: Dicey Rules: System Design in Baldur's Gate 3
> **Citation:** Janik, T. (2024). *DiGRA Digital Library*. [Link](https://doi.org/10.26503/dl.v2025i2.2433)
> **Category:** `#systems` `#mechanics`
> 
> * **What it covers:** A recent academic analysis of how Larian Studios translated the complex, math-heavy rules of *Dungeons & Dragons* (5th Edition) into a fluid video game experience. It focuses on the automation of dice rolls.
> * **Why it is valuable:** It bridges tabletop theory and software engineering. For a Computing Applications major, seeing how "pen and paper" logic is refactored into automated code is incredibly relevant.
> * **Who would benefit:** System designers and programmers interested in the adaptation of analog rule sets into digital environments.
> * **Limitations:** It requires some familiarity with D&D rules (like d20 rolls and modifiers) to fully grasp the complexities.
