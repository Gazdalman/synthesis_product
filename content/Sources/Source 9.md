> **Category:** `#systems` `#mechanics`
> * **What it covers:** This is a relatively famous paper in game engineering. It breaks games down into three layers: Mechanics (the code/rules), Dynamics (the system in motion), and Aesthetics (the player's immersion). 
> * **Why it is valuable:** It is literally the "Architecture" of your title. It explains how you write code (Mechanics) to create an emotional response (Immersion). It proves that immersion is an output of a system, not just "good graphics.
> * **Who would benefit:** Systems designers who need a framework to explain why a mechanic feels "fun" or "immersive."
> * **Limitations:** It is a theoretical framework, so it does not provide specific code examples for any particular engine.
