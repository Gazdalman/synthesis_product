>[!cite] Source 11: Diegesis and Designing for Immersion
>**Citation:** Lucas, F. (2018). *Game Developer*. [Link](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/diegesis-and-designing-for-immersion)
>**Category:** `#immersion` `#ux`

>* **What it covers:** A definitive breakdown of "Diegetic UI" which are interfaces that exist within the game world (like the map in *Firewatch* or the holographic ammo counter in *Dead Space*) versus non-diegetic overlays. 
>* **Why it is valuable:** This article provides a clear, definitional framework for a concept that is often misunderstood. By categorizing UI into specific types (diegetic, spatial, meta), it gives the collection precise terminology for analyzing interface design beyond vague feelings of immersion.
>* **Who would benefit:** UI artists who want to stop making boring pause menus and start building interfaces that feel "real." 
>* **Limitations:** It acknowledges that diegetic UI can sometimes hurt usability (e.g., reading a tiny map in the dark), forcing a trade-off between realism and function.
