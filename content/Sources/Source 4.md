> [!cite] Source 4: The Design in Narrative Design
> **Citation:** Horneman, J. *GDC Archive*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8VIlfTtypg)
> **Category:** `#systems` `#agency`
> 
> * **What it covers:** Horneman argues that narrative design is a *system* akin to combat or economy design. He details how quest structures, tracking variables, and game logic are just as important to the story as the actual dialogue written by the writers.
> * **Why it is valuable:** This source validates the "Computing Applications" angle of my project. It shifts the focus from "writing good sentences" to "engineering good story systems," which is the core of my interest.
> * **Who would benefit:** Programmers who want to work in story-heavy games but don't consider themselves "writers."
> * **Limitations:** It is abstract and high-level; it doesn't provide specific code snippets or tutorials.
