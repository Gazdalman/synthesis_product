> [!cite] Source 14: The Proteus Effect
> **Citation:** Yee, N., & Bailenson, J. (2007). *Human Communication Research*.
> **Category:** `#psychology` `#immersion`
> 
>* **What it covers:** The original study that coined the "Proteus Effect" or the phenomenon where a player's behavior changes based on the appearance of their avatar. For example, players assigned taller avatars negotiated more aggressively, while those with attractive avatars stood closer to other characters and disclosed more personal information.
>* **Why it is valuable:** This article is valuable because it provides empirical proof that role-playing is not just a conscious acting choice, but a subconscious psychological reaction to visual design. It proves that the visual assets directly manipulate player behavior, meaning designers can code player personality through character design.
>* **Who would benefit:** Character artists and RPG designers who want to subtly influence how players act without using dialogue or rules.
>* **Limitations:** The original study focused on social VR and negotiations, so the direct application to single-player combat is inferential rather than proven.
