> [!cite] Source 10: Narrative Legos
> **Citation:** Levine, K. (2014). *GDC Vault*. [Link](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1020434/Narrative) 
> **Category:** `#agency` `#systems` `#narrative`
> * **What it covers:** Ken Levine, the creator of *BioShock*, critiques linear RPGs, arguing that once a scripted story is played, the agency is dead. He proposes "Narrative Legos" which is the concept of breaking characters into systemic variables (Passions, Hatreds, Needs) that the game engine can recombine endlessly to generate new stories.
> * **Why it is valuable:** It treats storytelling as a machine system. Instead of writing a static script, Levine proposes programming a "Narrative Engine." This fits the project perfectly by framing Agency as an engineering challenge rather than a writing challenge.
> * **Who would benefit:** Narrative designers and AI programmers trying to build replayable RPGs where choices actually matter.
> * **Limitations:** The concept is extremely difficult to implement; Levine himself spent a decade trying to build this system for his next game
