> * **What it covers:** This academic paper scientifically defines "immersion" and distinguishes it from the concept of "flow state." It reviews decades of psychological research to create a unified model of how players engage with virtual worlds.
> * **Why it is valuable:** It provides the necessary scientific vocabulary for the project. Understanding the cognitive difference between "being in the zone" (flow) and "feeling present" (immersion) is critical for analyzing RPGs.
> * **Who would benefit:** Students writing academic papers on gaming or developers trying to understand the "why" behind player retention.
> * **Limitations:** It is a dense academic text filled with jargon, making it less accessible for casual readers.
