> [!cite] Source 5: Power Progression in Games
> **Citation:** *Game Developer Magazine Archives*. [Link](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/power-progression-in-games-crafting-rewarding-player-experiences)
> **Category:** `#systems` `#psychology`
> 
> * **What it covers:** This article breaks down the psychology of "leveling up" and progression loops. It explains the balance between intrinsic motivation (mastery of skills) and extrinsic motivation (loot, XP, and badges) to keep players hooked.
> * **Why it is valuable:** RPGs live or die by their progression systems. This source explains the mathematical and psychological hooks that make "grinding" feel rewarding rather than tedious.
> * **Who would benefit:** Game designers focusing on economy balance and player retention strategies.
> * **Limitations:** It focuses heavily on the "hook" of engagement, which can veer into "addiction mechanics" rather than pure artistic immersion.
