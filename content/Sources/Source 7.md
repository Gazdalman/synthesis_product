> [!cite] Source 7: Disco Elysium and Narrative Superposition
> **Citation:** Post45. (2024). *Contemporary Literature Analysis*. [Link](https://post45.org/2024/04/disco-elysium-and-narrative-superposition/) 
> **Category:** `#agency` `#narrative`
> * **What it covers:** An in-depth analysis of how *Disco Elysium* creates the illusion of infinite player choice ("superposition") while actually maintaining a rigid deterministic text. It argues that true narrative agency comes from the player's internal interpretation, not just changing the ending. 
> * **Why it is valuable:** It challenges the traditional RPG definition of "Agency." Instead of "Changing the World," it defines agency as "Changing the Meaning," which is a crucial distinction for modern narrative design. 
> * **Who would benefit:** Narrative designers and writers struggling to write branching storylines who need a more manageable framework.
> * **Limitations:** It uses complex literary theory terminology which may be dense for those without a humanities background.
