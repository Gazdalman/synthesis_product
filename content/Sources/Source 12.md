> [!cite] Source 12: Narrative Sorcery: Coherent Storytelling in an Open World 
> **Citation:** Ingold, J. (2016). *GDC Vault*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZft_U4Fc-U) 
> **Category:** `#ux` `#narrative`
> 
> * **What it covers:** Jon Ingold (Inkle Studios) details the "Defensive Logic" used in *Sorcery!*. He explains how they code fallback options (like "Ready myself") to ensure that no matter what weird state the player is in, the narrative never breaks or halts. 
> * **Why it is valuable:** It reframes narrative logic as a User Experience (UX) challenge. The goal isn't just to tell a story; it's to engineer a system that proactively responds to user input without error, ensuring the "flow" of the experience is never interrupted by logic bugs. 
> * **Who would benefit:** Technical Narrative Designers and UX leads who need to prevent "dead ends" in branching stories. 
> * **Limitations:** It is highly technical regarding the "Ink" scripting language, focusing on the backend logic rather than the visual interface.
