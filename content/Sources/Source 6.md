> [!cite] Source 6: The Secret of Immersive Game HUDs
> **Citation:** Game Maker’s Toolkit. *YouTube*. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoyT4fN1cE4)
> **Category:** `#ux` `#immersion`
> 
> * **What it covers:** This video essay analyzes "diegetic" interfaces such as UI elements that exist within the game world (like the health bar on the character's back in *Dead Space*) versus traditional overlays. It argues for minimizing menus to maintain immersion.
> * **Why it is valuable:** Immersion isn't just about writing; it's about what the player *sees*. This source covers the visual/UI aspect of the project, ensuring the collection isn't just textheavy theory.
> * **Who would benefit:** UI/UX designers and indie developers looking for creative ways to display information without cluttering the screen.
> * **Limitations:** It focuses strictly on visual presentation and does not cover the coding backend required to implement these systems.
