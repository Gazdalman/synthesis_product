> * **What it covers:** An analysis of the Caelid region in *Elden Ring*, contrasting it with typical green post-apocalyptic settings. It argues that the landscape itself narrates a story of ecological collapse and the failure of stewardship, creating horror through rot and stagnation rather than traditional scares.
> * **Why it is valuable:** This essay is valuable because it bridges the gap between mechanical immersion and narrative theme. It provides a specific case study of how level design functions as a storytelling device, offering a concrete example for the collection rather than just abstract theory.
> * **Who would benefit:** Level designers and narrative writers looking to create horror atmospheres without relying on scripted sequences or jump scares.
> * **Limitations:** It focuses heavily on a specific zone (Caelid) rather than the game's mechanics as a whole.
