# The World: Environmental Storytelling and Systems

A living world communicates its history without relying on text logs. According to Hemmann's analysis of Elden Ring, the landscape itself functions as a storytelling device, using the rot and stagnation of the Caelid region to narrate a story of ecological collapse and the failure of stewardship. 

However, an immersive world also requires robust underlying systems. When designing a living ecology, developers must write exact code logic, which Raph Koster explains was necessary for Ultima Online to handle concepts like producing resources, eating grass, or desiring gold. When building these environments, designers cannot just code the biology; they must also account for systemic fragility and the chaotic human element of players who will inevitably break those systems.
