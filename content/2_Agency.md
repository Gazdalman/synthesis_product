# Agency: The Player's Choice

Players feel immersed when they believe their choices matter. Creating genuine agency requires careful choice architecture, which Josh Sawyer explains was achieved in Fallout: New Vegas by tracking variables to manage reputation systems and faction disguises. Narrative design is a system akin to combat, where quest structures and game logic are just as important as the dialogue written by writers, as argued by Horneman.

Instead of static scripts, Ken Levine proposes building a narrative engine using Narrative Legos, breaking characters down into systemic variables like Passions, Hatreds, and Needs that can recombine endlessly. This requires defensive logic, which Jon Ingold notes is crucial in games like Sorcery! for coding fallback options that prevent the narrative from breaking no matter what weird state the player is in. Finally, a recent Post45 analysis of Disco Elysium suggests that true narrative agency might simply be the illusion of infinite choice, where the player is changing the meaning of the text rather than changing the actual world.
