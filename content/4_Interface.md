# The Interface: Immersion vs. Information 

The user interface is the literal lens through which the player sees the game. As highlighted by the Game Maker's Toolkit, traditional overlays can break immersion, making it vital to minimize menus and utilize diegetic interfaces that exist within the game world. A prime example of this is the health bar placed directly on the character's back in Dead Space.

Lucas provides a definitive breakdown of this concept in Game Developer, categorizing UI into specific types like diegetic, spatial, and meta. This gives designers precise terminology for analyzing interface design. However, Lucas also acknowledges that diegetic UI can sometimes hurt usability, such as forcing a player to read a tiny map in the dark, which forces a trade-off between realism and function.
