# The Foundation: Defining Immersion 

To build an immersive world, we must first define what immersion actually is. This requires distinguishing the feeling of being present from simply being in the zone or experiencing flow. Michailidis et al define flow as "being in the zone". Immersion is defined as "feeling present"[^1]. Immersion is not just about writing good lore. It is a measurable output of a game's architecture.

We can understand this through the MDA framework presented by Hunicke, LeBlanc, and Zubek, which breaks games down into three layers which are Mechanics, Dynamics, and Aesthetics.[^3] The mechanics are the code and rules, the dynamics are the system in motion, and the aesthetics are the resulting emotional response or immersion of the player. Furthermore, as Janik points out in their analysis of Baldur's Gate 3, even analog rules like tabletop dice rolls must be refactored into automated code to build these underlying mechanics.[^2] By treating immersion as a systemic output rather than just good graphics, developers can engineer better experiences.
