# Psychology: The Subconscious Mind 

The final pillar of immersion involves the invisible psychological hooks that manipulate player behavior. Yee and Bailenson's original study on the Proteus Effect proves that visual assets directly manipulate player behavior. For example, players assigned taller avatars negotiated more aggressively, while those with attractive avatars stood closer to other characters and disclosed more personal information. This means designers can actually code player personality through character art. 

Furthermore, keeping players engaged requires a deep understanding of progression loops. As detailed by Game Developer Magazine, RPGs live or die by their progression systems. Designers must constantly balance intrinsic motivation, like the mastery of skills, with extrinsic motivation, such as loot, XP, and badges, to ensure the grinding experience feels rewarding rather than tedious.
